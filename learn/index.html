Ordinary citizens have no equivalent "network of last resort"… or at least they didn't until Meshtastic was developed. Meshtastic is being used in (preparation for) emergency scenarios by ordinary citizens because it is inexpensive to buy individual nodes and doesn't depend on infrastructure. Meshtastic's relay (mesh) functionality is automatic, and it can easily be deployed by individuals or in groups such as a neighborhood.</blockquote>

                            <p>We have set up a number of solar-powered radio repeaters across Montana and continue expanding statewide. These radios communicate on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/33-centimeter_band">906.875 MHZ</a> frequency using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRa protocol</a>. The radios mesh using the open-source <a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> software. Users can connect to these repeaters by Bluetooth if they're close enough or they can use their own handheld nodes which will also act as repeaters. The messages hop from node to node, extending the reach of the network and ensuring everyone receives every message.</p>

                            <p><strong>The Paper Note Analogy:</strong></p>
                            <p>Pretend you're sitting in class and want to send a note to everyone in the class. You write your note on a piece of paper and copy it three times. The message can be up to 228 characters - about as long as this paragraph so far. You hand those three pieces of paper to the three people around you. Then those three people re-write the message three times and hand it to the three people around them and so on. Now imagine a big gust of wind comes and blows away some of the messages. If even just a few people saw the note and keep copying and re-sending it, eventually everyone will get a copy of the note. This is like sending an unencrypted message to everyone on the network.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Secret Messages:</strong></p>
                            <p>Now imagine you want to send a message to a single person or a select group of people but you don't want other people who see the note to be able to read it. You could write the note using a secret language. You could then hand a decoder key to your friend or to a group of friends and they could decode the message. The message still gets passed the same way - with every single person writing the message a few times and handing it to everyone - but only those people with the decoder key will be able to understand the message. This is like sending an encrypted direct message or encrypted group message.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>MTMesh is just like this:</strong></p>
                            <p>MTMesh works the same way as this paper example, but instead of sending paper notes we're using digital text messages and sending it with radio waves. Our radios are solar powered and they don't need any internet or cell phone coverage. This means they will work even if the power is out.</p>

This big city-wide group text chain could allow people to ask for help or offer assistance. People could get information about where warming centers are open or ask who in their neighborhood still has power. People could also send encrypted direct messages to check in on friends and family or they could send encrypted group messages to coordinate privately in a group.</p>

MTMesh is open to everyone - you don't have to ask permission to join and all of the software is open-source. MTMesh is resilient - our solar-powered radios don't need cell phone towers, internet access, or electricity.

                    <p class="text-center text-large mb-xl">For people who are familiar with using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Packet_Reporting_System">Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS)</a> on ham radio, Meshtastic is <strong>similar</strong> in a few ways:</p>

                                        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-sm">Digipeaters</h4>
                                        <p class="text-small">APRS radios can be set up as clients, which receive all messages and only transmit the users messages, or APRS radios can be set up as digipeaters, which repeat all the messages they hear. Meshtastic radios by default all act as repeaters – just like APRS digipeaters.</p>
                                    </div>

                                        <p class="text-small">MQTT Gateways are like APRS iGates – they repeat all local traffic over the internet to other MQTT Gateways around the world.</p>

                                        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-sm">ANSRVR</h4>
                                        <p class="text-small">APRS users can subscribe to groups using the ANSRVR service. This allows for group chats like the popular #APRSThursday net. Meshtastic has "Secondary Channels" that can be subscribe to, allowing users to send messages to everyone on the channel.</p>

                                        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-sm">Burst</h4>
                                        <p class="text-small">APRS uses the AX.25 protocol which sends messages using data bursts between 0.3 and 0.5 seconds long. Meshtastic uses the LoRa protocol which sends messages in data bursts between 0.5 and 10 seconds long.</p>

                                        <p class="text-small">APRS doesn't have a way to broadcast a message to everyone on the network. Messages sent to Meshtastic's Primary Channel go to everyone.</p>
                                    </div>

                                        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-sm">Encryption</h4>
                                        <p class="text-small">APRS is unencrypted because it is illegal to use encryption over ham radio. Meshtastic is encrypted for communications on private group channels and for direct messages between users, because it runs on the 900 MHz ISM band, which does not have restrictions on encryption.</p>
                                    </div>

                                        <p class="text-small">APRS requires the user to have a ham radio license. Meshtastic does not require any license and is open for anyone to use.</p>

                                        <p class="text-small">APRS capable handheld ham radios cost upwards of $400. Meshtastic radios cost less than $100.</p>

                                        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-sm">Email</h4>
                                        <p class="text-small">APRS has services which allow users to send emails and SMS text messages to people who aren't ham radio users. Meshtastic does not have this feature but it could be added in the future.</p>

                                        <h4 class="font-semibold mb-sm">Simplicity</h4>
                                        <p class="text-small">APRS is quite a bit more difficult to use than Meshtastic. APRS does not have any standardized user interface – there are dozens of software packages available. Meshtastic has a standardized iPhone and Android app which is easy to understand for new users.</p>

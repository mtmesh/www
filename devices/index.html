                                <p>Using RAK RAKBox-B2 Enclosure with solar panel. The panel was connected directly to the RAK Wireless WisBlock Meshtastic Starter Kit US915. We connected a 2000 MAh Lithium Polymer battery directly to the RAK board. We drilled a hole in the top of the box and attached a fiberglass antenna, which was connected to the RAK board with an iPEX to N-Type connector. We mounted this on top of one of the UT buildings and it died within a month. The 0.4 watt panel is way too small.</p>

                                <p>Same as 1.0 but we added a second 5 watt solar panel that was connected to the RAK board via USB. Also died within a month.</p>

                                <summary>Version 3.0 Internal Solar, Power Module, 18650's</summary>
                                <p>To minimize the amount of components outside the box we used a much larger box with a clear lid and placed the solar panel inside the box. We added a Texas Instruments Green Power Module between the solar panel and the RAK board to help regulate the power. For batteries we switched to using four 18650 batteries and we also added an overdischarge protection circuit from Voltaic Enclosures (not to be confused with Voltaic Systems) between the battery and the RAK board to provide clean shutoff when battery voltage fell below 2.5v. We mounted this on top of the UT buildings and it died in 3 months.</p>

                                <p>Same as Version 3.0 but we mounted the solar panel outside of the box (using a smaller box). We mounted this on a pole and it died within 3 months.</p>

                                <p>For this version we stopped using the RAK's solar and battery connectors entirely. Instead we connected a large 12 watt solar panel to a Voltaic Systems battery via USB and then connected the battery to the RAK board via USB. The Voltaic Systems battery acts as the solar charge controller and also acts as the overdischarge protection circuit; the battery will charge at a range of voltages from the solar panel (if it gets shaded) and the battery will shut off if the voltages drops too low and will reboot itself once it has recharged sufficiently.</p>

                            <div class="card-content">
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Don't trust the RAK board to handle varying solar voltage or varying battery voltage. It is very unhappy if either voltage goes outside of a narrow range. In fact there is a <a href="https://meshtastic.discourse.group/t/rak-4631-solar-repeater/7694/7">known issue</a> where the Nordic nRF52840 module inside of the RAK 4631 chip causes it to enter a "Super Deep Sleep" fault state when it is supplied with 3.3V. This means when the battery voltage falls too low the RAK chip shuts down and can only be rebooted manually.</li>
                                    <li>Solar panels: bigger is better. 10 watts or more is ideal.</li>
                                    <li>Battery: bigger is better. 5,000 mAh or more is ideal.</li>
                                    <li>Antenna: fiberglass antennas are the most robust and can handle wind, rain, and UV light better than rubber ducky antennas.</li>
                                    <li>Heat can kill the battery – it is best to shade the box containing the battery.</li>
                                    <li>Don't add any modules. The GPS module increases battery usage significantly and is unnecessary if the repeater is in a fixed position.</li>
                                    <li>Seal everything properly and make sure water has a way to get out of the case. Use o-rings for the antenna mount and wrap connectors in proxicast. Add a drain plug to the case so any condensation has a way to escape. For high humidity environments, spray the electronics with conformal coating.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p class="mt-md">These are lessons learned from extreme weather conditions, where the main environmental stressors can be heat, cold, and storms. Temperature extremes can cause equipment failure, so proper enclosure design and temperature management are critical. Weather conditions can vary widely throughout the day and seasons, requiring robust designs that can handle temperature swings and humidity changes. Our learnings are applicable to various climate conditions, though specific considerations may vary by region.</p>

                                    <summary>Details on the boards that died</summary>
                                    <p>One was filled with water, the antenna seal didn't work. That's why the vent valve at the bottom is so important. One died because it got stuck in the low voltage state that requires a physical reset - that's fixed with the Voltaic packs. The third one died due to unknown causes but heat is suspected. When we tried to reboot with with wall power it wouldn't turn on - so the board was totally fried. That one I also sprayed with covalent coating nasty stuff that we won't use any more.</p>

                            <p>With all that said, here is the parts list for our most-preferred way to build a solar powered repeater. This design doesn't require any soldering or complicated connectors. It also doesn't require any battery management chips (which often have long shipping lead times and can be hard to get). For this design the solar panel is connected directly to the battery pack via USB. Then the battery pack is connected to the board via USB. The Voltaic Systems V25 battery is nice because it is optimized to charge from a solar panel and it is set standard to an "always on" mode which means the battery bank does not shut off after a set amount of time like other battery packs – this is useful as the RAK chip uses very little power and can trick other battery packs into shutting off. The other really nice thing about the Voltaic pack is than when it drains down completely it shuts down, but then once the solar panel has sufficiently charged it back up it will automatically turn itself back on again. The RAK radio uses between 100 and 1000 mAh per day, with about 400 mAh per day being average so theoretically the 6,400mAh Voltaic V25 could keep the radio running for 16 days without solar.</p>

Simply paint the top of the birdhouse black and glue on the solar panel, cut a hole in the back of the birdhouse big enough to put the box into it, attach the antenna mount L-Bracket to the side of the birdhouse, and connect the box to the antenna on the mount with the pigtail using the jam nut.</p>

                        <p class="text-large">As you may already know, the mesh technology we use relies on the LoRa technology in the 900mhz frequency range. This means that connection is dependent on Line of Site (LoS) between the antennas. <strong>The easiest way to ensure LoS is with height</strong>. The easiest (though temporary) way to get height is through an aerial platform including but not limited to UAVs (drones or planes) or kites!</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Schedule:</strong> Most drones will only fly for 15-30m per battery. Schedule communication windows specifically so that batteries are not wasted. Consider prescheduling times with your group to either have multiple drones up at once, or extend windows by alternating who is in the air.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> Use 2 nodes. One on the ground that you connect to with your devices and one on the drone. Set the node on the drone Router or Router Late to ensure messages actually pass through. If set to Client it may not retransmit the packet as it has already heard the packet from multiple other ground nodes. Consider setting the ground node to Client Mute.</li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Due to the short flight times, your node can use a very small battery. Think 100mah. Strip all non necessary items.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Fly in open areas. Use minimum height necessary. Make sure the node is secure and can't tip or the antenna fold which may hit propellers which will cause a crash. Avoid hanging the node unless there is no other solution. Hanging nodes easily swing up and hit propellers.</li>
